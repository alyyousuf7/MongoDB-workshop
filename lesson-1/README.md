# MongoDB Shell Basics
The goal is to get a basic idea of Mongo Shell commands and how to use them


### 1. Start mongo daemon 

```
C:\> net start MongoDb  // if installed as windows service

OR 

C:\> mongod  // PATH variable should be set correctly

OR

C:\> "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.2\bin\mongo.exe"
```

### 2. Start mongo shell

```
C:\> mongo
```

Note: this will connect using the default port 27017. Use -p for specifying a different port.

You should get an output similar to the following

```
MongoDB shell version v4.2.0
connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
Implicit session: session { "id" : UUID("2323-8as8-23aa-8fsa") }
MongoDB server version: 4.2.0
>
```

From this moment on, everything youâ€™ll type will be executed in the mongo shell.


### 3. List databases

Your server may host several different databases you have access to

```
> show dbs
admin      0.000GB
config     0.000GB
local      0.000GB
```

### 4. Find the current database your are connection with
```
>db
test
```

### 5. Select / Create a database

Database is automatically created if it does not exists

```
> use shop

> db
shop
```

Note: `show dbs` will not show the new database because it is empty.


### 6. Create collection 


```
db.createCollection("products")

OR 
db.products.insertOne({name:"paper",price:10, description:"A4 size papers"})

```

Collections can be capped by setting size / max documents.

### 7. Run few insert commands to insert some data

```
db.products.insertOne({name:"Book",price:10, description:"A book"})

```

### 8. List collections
```
>show collections
products
```

### 9. Find all documents

```
>db.products.find()

>db.products.find().pretty()
```

### 10. View logs

```
> show log global

```

### Some more commands
you can always use help command to get list of all available commands 
```
>db.dropDatebase()
>db.getState()
```
